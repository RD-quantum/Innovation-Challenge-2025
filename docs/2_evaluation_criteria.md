# Evaluation Criteria

## 1. Problem Understanding & Approach (0-5 pts)

- Comparison to state of the art: Does the team clearly define the problem and put it into context?
- Technical Feasibility: Is the approach reasonable given current or near turn quantum computational/AI hardware capacities? 
- Innovativeness: Does the solution bring a novel perspective or improvement compared to existing approaches? Has the participant demonstrated (potential) advantage over classical methods (e.g. speedup, accuracy, resource efficiency)? 
- Scalability: Can the approach be extended or scaled up? For larger PKPD datasets can this solution adapted for another use case such as drug resistance prediction?

## 2. Computational Resource Estimation (0-5 pts)
- Hardware Requirements: Did the team estimate the needed computational resources (GPUs, CPUs)? 

## 3. Technical Assessment (0-5 pts)
- Choice of Algorithms: Are the selected algorithms appropriate for the task?
- Justification of Methods: Is there a solid reasoning behind using specific architectures or techniques?
- Benchmark with existing solutions: Are existing solutions considered and benchmarked?

## 4. Structure of the Work Plan (0-5 pts)
- Step-by-Step Breakdown: Does the participant outline a clear roadmap how to approach the challenge?
- Risk Assessment & Mitigation: Are potential failure points identified with alternative solutions?

## 5. Team skills 0-5 (pts)
- Skillset: Does the team cover the necessary experience in quantum/AI techniques?

## 6. Proof of Concept / Prototype (non-mandatory; 0-5pts)
    • Prototype Implementation: Has the team built a minimal working proof of concept? 
    • Initial Results: Are preliminary results provided?
    • Demonstration of Key Concepts: Does the proof of concept validate core ideas effectively?
